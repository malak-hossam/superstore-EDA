# Superstore Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Description
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Superstore dataset. The primary goal is to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations.

## Dataset
The Superstore dataset includes information about sales, profits, discounts, and other attributes related to various products sold by a hypothetical retail store. The dataset typically contains the following columns:
- Order ID
- Order Date
- Ship Date
- Ship Mode
- Customer ID
- Customer Name
- Segment
- Country
- City
- State
- Postal Code
- Region
- Product ID
- Category
- Sub-Category
- Product Name
- Sales
- Quantity
- Discount
- Profit

## Objectives
- Understand the overall structure and characteristics of the dataset.
- Identify key trends and patterns in sales and profit.
- Explore relationships between different variables.
- Detect any anomalies or outliers in the data.
- Provide actionable insights that could help improve business decisions.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
1. **superstore.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA process, including data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.
2. **Sample - Superstore.csv**: The Superstore dataset used for the analysis.
